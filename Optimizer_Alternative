This is an alternative to the first "simple" optimizer.

1) calculate LCM based on recast time for each spell in spellbook
2) create a list of enough copies of each spell to "fill" the LCM
3) create an optimized "knapsack" with spell list from step 2, Cost = casting time, value = damage
4) schedule knapsack from 3, using a greedy algorithm based on Recast duration

Deadline = recast time + 1
Execution = casting time
Period = recast time
